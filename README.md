How did we figure out which problems to match non-profits with? Python of course!

Check out our Jupyter Notebook in the code directory for more info.  If you don't have Jupyter installed on your computer, use [this link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/2018-Arizona-Opportunity-Hack/npo-selection/blob/master/code/Opportunity%20Hack%202018%20Arizona%20-%20NPO%20Selection.ipynb) to view all rendered charts and graphs.
