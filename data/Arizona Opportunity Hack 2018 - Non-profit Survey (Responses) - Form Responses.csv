I have interviewed over 300 nonprofit organizations and this is one of the top 4 needs for all nonprofits, especially smaller nonprofits. We need a system that curates all of the nonprofits' needs and alerts them when a donation is available from a business or individual donor. All small nonprofits are dying on the vine because they cannot get the items they need. Meanwhile, businesses and individuals are throwing perfectly good food & items into the landfill. This destroys our beautiful desert landscape and pollutes our groundwater. We all need a Donate Item Alert System Project. Here is the problem we are trying to solve:

1.      We need to create an alert system that lets us know when a business or individual has a donation to pick up. It needs to be quick & easy.

2.      We have to alert transportation volunteers that a donation needs to be picked up. A system like Uber would be great so that we know which volunteer took the request and assure that the donation was picked up.

3.      We need to track which primary sorting location the item went to.

4.      We need to track which nonprofit or school needs the item and where they are located.

5.      We need to create efficient systems for tracking which storage locations the donations are stored in.

6.      We need to track how many of each items are at each storage space.

7.      We need an efficient way of tracking what items need to be moved to different parts of the valley and we need a fuel efficient way of deciding the route for drop off of items to the final nonprofit destination.

8.      We need to track who got the donated items for tax write offs and thank yous to donors."
